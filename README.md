# Extracting Insights About Deep Learning Posts From StackOverflow

Proposed Dataset: Stack Overflow from data stack exchange  

## RESEARCH QUESTION 1:
How does the effect of previous experiences/reputation reflect on the quality of questions and answers?  

### Complementary questions:  
* How does the designation (e.g. student, researcher, developer, professor, etc.) of the user affect the quality of questions and answers posted?  
* How does the reputation (beginner or expert) of a user affect the quality of answers (no of up-votes) and time taken for that answer?  

#### Motivation:  

By clustering the quality of questions or answers according to a linear combination of designation and reputation, we can identify and prioritize new answers or upcoming trending questions. This would help in accumulating quick exposure to new useful/important topics and answers posted by reputed users and reducing exposure to less important/useful topics and answers posted by inexperienced users.

## RESEARCH QUESTION 2:  
How long does it take for a person to answer correctly (most acceptable answer) a question (after it is posted) for each category/topic?  

#### Motivation:  
Depending on the features of the posted question and features of the user with the most upvoted answer of a particular deep learning topic/category, an effective turnaround/answer time could be suggested to interested users/the enquirer. e.g) Features of the users could be geographic location, designation/job/ reputation, and age, while the features of the question could be the deep learning topic (categorical), up/down votes, presence of code segment/snippet etc.
